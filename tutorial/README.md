# muzikilo.js Tutorial

Hey,  
You sucessfully found the tutorial page to get you started making music with `muzikilo.js` :).
You best start by coppy-pasting the contents of the first tutorial file [101_sine_wave.js](./101_sine_wave.js)
into [muzikilo.js](https://anuejn.github.io/muzikilo.js) and read the comments / hack on the code :).

You can then advance with the other Tutorial steps in the same way if you feel like it.
When you feel ready, you can create your own creations, [or look at what others have](https://github.com/anuejn/muzikilo.js/wiki/Random-compositions)
done as a source of inspiration. Also feel free to share what you have done :).
